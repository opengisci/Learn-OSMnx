## Abstract

This is a python Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use the OSMnx python package to query road data from OpenStreetMap, build a network, save as a geopackage, and correct and calculate speed limits and travel times.

## Study Metadata

- `Key words`: Network analysis, OSMnx, NetworkX, Python, OpenStreetMap
- `Subject`: Social and Behavioral Sciences: Geography: Geographic Information Sciences
- `Date created`: 09-July-2024

- `Spatial Coverage`: New England
- `Spatial Resolution`: Varies by region. Network edges are simplified to connect nodes at intersections or dead ends.
- `Spatial Reference System`: EPSG:4326
- `Temporal Coverage`: Specify the temporal extent of your study---i.e. the range of time represented by the data observations.
- `Temporal Resolution`: n/a - data acquired for one moment in time

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
- Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
